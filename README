# Project Setup Guide

Welcome to my University Habit Tracker Project! Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running with Github Codespaces.

## Step 1: Initialize your environment

1. **Open Github Codespaces** for the repository.
2. **Prepare the environment setup script** by running the following command:

```
chmod +x setup_myenv.sh
```

3. **Execute the setup script** to configure your environment:

```
./setup_myenv.sh
```


## Step 2: Activate the environment

1. **Source the Conda configuration**:

```
. /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
```

2. **Activate your Conda environment**:

```
conda activate myenv
```


## Step 3: Start the development server

1. **Navigate to your project directory**:

```
cd myproject
```

2. **Run the Django development server**:

```
python manage.py runserver
```


## Step 4: Access the application

**Login credentials**:

**Admin access:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `adminpassword`

**User access:**
- Username: `user`
- Password: `userpassword`

**Note**: The initial login load might take some time. This is normal during the first setup.

After completing these steps, your development environment should be ready, and you can access the application using the provided credentials. If you encounter any issues, please consult the FAQ or submit an issue on the repository.
